* ~ pink-bliss-UwU theme for Emacs ~
Uses the older pink-bliss theme by Alex Schroeder as a base, and aims to be more modern. This includes theming for org-mode, helm, newer programming languages and much more. As this is a modern theme, it also will get rid of redundant 256 colors checks everywhere. Aims to be modern theme for computers in $currentYear.

Work in progress, so some colors and color combinations might change slightly. Feel free to help out in this process if you also would like a pink UwU theme :sparkles:

** Installation and usage
*** Manual
Clone this repository to a path you can remember on your machine. Then you can simply add it and use in your config:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path
               "/path/to/theme")

  ;; use it
  (load-theme 'pink-bliss-uwu t)
#+END_SRC
(if you don't want to load it right away, you can omit the last line and load it later with =M-x load-theme= and select =pink-bliss-uwu=)

*** use-package (local, NOT yet on MELPA)
(like in the previous step) Clone this repository to a path you can remember on your machine. Then you can use =use-package= to load it:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package pink-bliss-uwu-theme
    :load-path "/path/to/theme"
    :config
    (load-theme 'pink-bliss-uwu t))
#+END_SRC

While it's not prettier than the manual install, it might help in keeping your configuration consistent and more readable.

*** straight.el with use-package
If you are one of the few who use straight.el, you can install it without manually cloning the repository.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package pink-bliss-uwu-theme
    :straight (pink-bliss-uwu-theme :type git :host github :repo "themkat/pink-bliss-uwu-theme")
    :config
    (load-theme 'pink-bliss-uwu t))
#+END_SRC

(if your local git install suddenly gets really anal on you in this one package: Remove the =:host= argument and put the ssh clone .git file into the =:repo= argument)
