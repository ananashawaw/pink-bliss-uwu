* ~ pink-bliss-UwU theme for Emacs ~
Uses the older pink-bliss theme by Alex Schroeder as a base, and aims to be more modern. This includes theming for org-mode, helm, newer programming languages and much more. As this is a modern theme, it also will get rid of redundant 256 colors checks everywhere. Aims to be modern theme for computers in $currentYear.

Work in progress, so some colors and color combinations might change slightly. Feel free to help out in this process if you also would like a pink UwU theme :sparkles:
